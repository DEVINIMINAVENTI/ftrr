     <h1>Welcome to another Money making post</h1>
    <p>There are more ways to make extra money than ever before, both online and offline. That's great, but knowing where to invest your time can be tricky.

        Use this list and discover new ideas to make money online and from home. Earn cash from walking, recycling, reviewing music and even searching the web.
        
        We'll update this page with fresh ways to make money fast, so go ahead and bookmark it.</p>

    <h1>1. No-risk matched betting</h1>
     <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/free_bets_matched_betting.jpg" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
    <p>Hands down the quickest way to make a lot of money from home. Lots of students have genuinely made £100s from this technique. It's completely legal, risk-free, tax-free, and anyone over 18 in the UK can do it.</p>
    <p>Matched betting works by taking advantage of free bets offered by betting sites and 'matching' them at a betting exchange. This removes the risk as you are betting both for and against an outcome.

        You can then squeeze out the free bet, which can be as much as £100. Multiply this by all the betting sites there are, and you can quite easily be in profit by a few hundred pounds.
        
        We walk you through how to make your first £13 profit (using a real example) in this gem of a guide to matched betting. If you know of any better way to make £40 an hour sitting at home, please let us know!</p>
   
    
    <h1>2. Online paid surveys</h1>

     <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/stepb.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
    <p>A popular way for people to make money online is to fill out online surveys in their spare time. Research companies are always recruiting new members worldwide to answer surveys and test new products.</p>
    <p>For a few minutes of form filling, you can quickly make a couple of quid which is paid as cash or rewards. You can bag up to £3 ($5) for some surveys!

        A few good ones to try are: Branded Surveys, Swagbucks, Toluna, Pinecone, LifePoints, i-Say, Opinion Outpost, YouGov, Prizerebel, Marketagent, InboxPounds, Valued Opinions, The Opinion Panel, Mingle, Opinion Bureau, Maru Voice, Panel Base, Y Live, Survey Junkie.</p>



    <h1>3. Searching the web</h1>

    <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"> <img src="../images/stepc.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>

    <h1>4. Online market trading</h1>
     <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/stepd.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
    <p>Investing in the stock market isn't necessarily an easy way to make money, but it can be lucrative if you learn to do it properly. By the same token, you may suffer significant losses if you don't take it seriously. <br>
        Today there is no need to fund the yachts of Wolf of Wall Street style stock brokers. You can do it all yourself with the help of online market trading platforms. <br>
        Having spent many hours researching this new opportunity, I've been using the popular platform <a href="https://www.etoro.com">eToro.com</a>.</p>
    <p>eToro has over 20 million users worldwide and offers free practice accounts. They featured in the BBC Two documentary "Traders: Millions by the Minute" and sponsor several Premier League football clubs.</p>


    <h1>5. Review websites & apps</h1>
     <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/usertesting.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>

    <p>Well, it seems like you're pretty nifty with a web browser. So perhaps it's time to turn pro and browse websites as a paid and fun job! <br>
        Introducing UserTesting - a platform that pays everyday people to review all kinds of websites. Each review takes around 20 minutes and bags you $10 (£6.50) via Paypal. <br>
        Simply <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">sign up here</a> , complete a test review and look forward to receiving websites in your inbox.</p>




    <h1>6. The 'Disney Vault' secret</h1>
    <p>To keep demand high across generations, Disney Studios restrict the supply of some home release classics. Physical blu-rays are locked away in the 'vault' for 8-10 years before being released for a short time. <br>
        Buy them in this window at normal retail price, and you can turn a nice profit when they go off sale for another decade or so.  <br>
        
        For example, in 2011 you could buy Beauty and the Beast on Blu-ray 3D for just £24.99. In just a couple of years it was on Amazon for a staggering £74.99! Importantly, not all Disney releases are subject to the vault and only the true classics will maintain such demand. <br>
        Right now there are just 2 titles out of the vault which I would recommend snapping up. They are <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Bambi Diamond Edition Blu-ray</a>  and <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">The Lion King Diamond Edition Blu-ray.</a> </p>

        <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"> <img src="../images/disney.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>






        <h1>7. 'Get Paid To' sites</h1>

        <p>Similar to making money from online surveys, GPT sites reward you in cash and vouchers for completing various offers or activities online.   </p>
        <p>The most popular sites today are <a href="">Toluna,</a>  <a href="">Swagbucks</a> and <a href="">InboxPounds</a>.</p>




        <h1>8. Become a delivery rider or driver</h1>

        <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"> <img src="../images/delivery.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
      
        <p>Own a bicycle, motorbike or car? What about a Smartphone? That's all you need to make extra money by delivering food or people whenever you have some spare time. <br>
            Sign up to delivery specialist companies like <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Deliveroo</a>  which are always on the hunt for new riders. They allow you total flexibility to work when you want, delivering food from restaurants to the customers' door. You can make up to £16 an hour. <br>
            Double-up your opportunities by directly contacting local takeaways and bigger chains like <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Dominos</a> to see if they have any delivery jobs going.</p>


        


    <h1>9. Publish a Kindle eBook</h1>

     <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/kindlebooks.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
    <p>If students are good at anything, it's researching and writing. With the Kindle store, anyone can publish an eBook and <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">make money on Amazon</a>. <br>
        The Kindle app is now available on any device so your global market is huge! <br>
        List your book for £1.49 - £6.99 and you earn 70% of the sale. Considering Amazon is the ultimate selling machine (and remember, people are looking to spend), that is a fantastic deal. <br>
        The key to success with eBooks is to create value, and write non-fiction. Bundling information you have researched and compiled on a common problem (eg. 'secrets' to finding a job) and then presenting it in an easy to digest format (an eBook) justifies someone spending a few quid on it. <br>

        Have a professional cover designed so it stands out <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">(browse these)</a>. <br>
        Once your eBook is live on the Kindle store, it's important to get some reviews so it shows up higher in results. Encourage readers to leave an honest review at the end of your book. <br>
        The best thing about this lucrative idea is that once you've invested the time (say 20 hours), you'll earn a passive income for years to come!

    <h1>10. Affiliate marketing</h1>

     <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/affiliate.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
    
    <p>If you have a social media following or a website, you can start making money immediately by promoting all sorts of companies, products, services and offers online. <br>
        Sign up as a publisher on the Awin network. Check their offers blog or browse the merchant listings to find something you think your followers would be interested in. Then grab your affiliate link and share it. <br>
        If someone buys using your link you'll make a nice commission (can be within up to 90 days).

    <h1>11. Find property for investors</h1>
    <p>We all know how much money there is in property, but on the surface you might be thinking this market is off-limits. <br>
        Truth is, lots of people make a great deal of cash by sourcing suitable properties for wealthy investors who are time poor. <br>
        The trick is to find properties below market value (BMV). Avoid estate agents and instead flyer your area with your contact details offering to buy houses for cash. <br>
        Then approach property investors with an offer to pass on details of cut-price properties in exchange for a percentage of the sale value. <br>
        Most cities have monthly networking events for landlords and property investors. Track these down, sign up, put on your best clothes and go along with lots of business cards. LinkedIn property investment groups are also good places to make initial contacts. <br>
        As you might imagine, this isn't necessarily a quick way to make money. But once you've got a few investors in your phone book it can prove to be very lucrative in the long run. If you're interested, I recommend reading this article. <br></p>



    <h1>12. Enter competitions</h1>

    <h1>13. Review music for money</h1>
    <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/slicethepie.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>

        <h1>14. Start dropshipping</h1>
        <p>Let’s start our list off with one of the most popular ways to make money online. According to Google Trends, dropshipping’s popularity is rising, highlighting its viability as a business idea. With success stories about how an entrepreneur made $6,667 in eight weeks or how a store owner made six figures selling just one product, there’s plenty of proof that dropshipping is a real way to make money online.<a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Learn how to get started on Upwork</a>.</p>
          <p>Total time: It can take a while to get your first gig. <br>
              <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">→ Click Here to Launch Your Online Business with Shopify</a>
              <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/dropshipping.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
              <p>If you don’t know what dropshipping is, it’s a business model where you sell a product to a customer, but the supplier stores, packages, and ships the product to your customers on your behalf. With Shopify dropshipping, you have access to millions of products that you can add to your store. Some Shopify dropshipping apps allow you to hand-pick your product images, edit item descriptions, and give your business a personalized vibe, so people will love shopping with you.</p>
          <p> Setup: 24 hours.
              How easy to start: Easy, if you have the expertise.
              Age threshold: 13+ but varies by site.
              Payment speed: Varies by site.</p>
              <p>The best way to make money dropshipping? Most entrepreneurs have been focusing on a few marketing strategies: Running <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Facebook ads</a>
                  Having influencers promote their products
                  Sending direct messages (DMs) to <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">potential customers on social media</a></p>
                  <p>Ready to start a store but need products to sell? <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Handshake</a> is where online entrepreneurs go to buy products at wholesale prices.</p>
              <br>
      
      
      
          <h1>15. Try print on demand</h1>
      
          <p><a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Print on demand</a> (POD) is another popular way to earn money online. Many individuals have adopted this business model because it has lower overhead than other businesses.</p>
          <p>Print on demand is similar to dropshipping in the sense that you don’t need to carry inventory or ship out products to customers yourself. There are two slight differences, though. First, you can make your own custom products, which is great for brand recognition. Second, you can choose from specific items rather than a vast range of categories. Most print-on-demand companies offer products that are easy to print on, like t-shirts, mugs, and tote bags. <br>
              The best way to make money with your print-on-demand business? <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Free marketing channels</a>. Your best bet would be to promote your products for free on Instagram and Pinterest, and through <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">social media influencers</a> who convert their audiences well.</p>
          <p>You can get a complete overview of print of demand versus dropshipping by watching us get into a healthy debate with <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Wholesale</a> Ted about the pros and cons of each business model.</p>

          <h1>16. Make money with affiliate marketing</h1>
          <p><a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Affiliate marketing</a> is one of the most popular ways to make money online. Throughout the years, its popularity has gone up and down, but it continues to be a stable way to earn through the internet. The best part about affiliate marketing is that you choose from a vast range of companies to partner with, including <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Shopify</a>, <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Amazon</a>, <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Uber</a> , and <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">FabFitFun</a>. <br>
              Affiliate marketing allows you to earn a living by promoting other brands. If you’re a savvy marketer, you can earn a commission from sales by promoting retail products, software, apps, and more. While earning a commission may seem small, keep in mind that you can be an affiliate for several brands and include several affiliate links on a single blog post. <br>
              If you really want to make money online doing affiliate marketing, your best bet is to focus on content marketing. By building out a blog with several pages of high-quality content, you create an asset you can call your own. Strategically place affiliate links in your blog posts to drive traffic to your affiliate partner’s website. </p>
      
      
          <h1>17. Start a YouTube channel</h1>
          <p>If others can make money from YouTube, so can you. The highest-paid YouTuber is Jimmy Donaldson (a.k.a. MrBeast), who uploads bizarre stunts on his YouTube channel, which made him $54 million in 2021. Another high earner is Jake Paul, who’s made $45 million on YouTube by sharing high-energy prank videos and boxing content. His YouTube (and boxing career) fame helped him use his influence to make money online beyond his YouTube earnings. <br>
              Your YouTube channel should focus on a single niche so you can build a strong, loyal audience. For example, you can create makeup tutorials, stream video games, review products, teach skills, create prank videos, or anything else you think there’d be an audience for. <br>
              </p>
          <p>The secret to making money on YouTube is to create content that people want. Create witty headlines to entice people to watch your videos and use keywords in your description to optimize for YouTube search. Once you’ve reached the 1,000-subscriber milestone, you can officially monetize your channel with YouTube ads.</p>
      <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/youtubechannel.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
      
      
      
      <h1>18. Become an influencer</h1>
      <p>Building a personal brand can also help you make money online. Did you know soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo charges between $880,259 and $1 million, on average, for a sponsored Instagram post? While it may seem like reality stars, singers, and athletes are the biggest influencers, keep in mind that even smaller-scale influencers can make more money today than they did a few years back.</p>
      <p>To become an influencer, you need to build a healthy following. The best platforms to get started on? Instagram and TikTok. Some of the biggest non-celebrity influencers often gained their first taste of exposure on these platforms. You might want to check out how to get more Instagram followers if you want to build a big Instagram audience.</p>
      <p>To make money as an influencer, you can charge for sponsored posts, create your own online store and sell products, add affiliate links in your bio, sell your photos, sell ads on your own podcast, make and sell merch, get paid to appear at events, and more.</p>
      
      
      
      <h1>19. Create an online course</h1>
      <p>Selling courses is one of the best ways to make money online. If you’re an expert on a subject, you can monetize your knowledge by creating courses online. You can sell your course on <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Udemy</a> or, if you already have your own audience, through your own website. Some entrepreneurs earn as much as <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">$5,000 per month with online courses</a>.</p>
      <p>To create a popular and successful course, take inspiration from trending courses in your niche. Then, look at the reviews. What are the aspects that people praise, and what are the things people hate? How can you create something better than what’s already been created? Focus on creating content that solves the biggest complaints while emulating the positive aspects people rave about.</p>
      <p>The platform you sell your course on will determine how to best make money. If you sell your course on Udemy, you don’t have to do much to promote it. You can almost set it and forget it. Maybe promote it to some blogs or on social media networks. However, if the course is hosted on your own website, you might want to run <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">ads</a> to promote the course. You can also <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">build an email list</a> to promote future courses without needing to pay for marketing.</p>
      <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/createonlinecourse.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
      
      
      
      <h1>20. Publish an ebook</h1>
      <p>With <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing</a>, it’s never been easier to publish an ebook. All you need to do is write the ebook, format it, create an ebook cover, publish it, and promote it. In 2013, I created several ebooks on Amazon, and even though it didn’t make me rich, I still made some money from it.</p>
      <p>You can choose to hire a writer for your ebook, a graphic designer to design the cover, and a manuscript editor to eliminate errors from the content. When researching the topic, focus on keywords based on popular searches on Amazon. I often use the Keyword Tool, which allows you to find the words people use while searching so you can craft your title around them.</p>

      <h1>21. Start a blog</h1>
      <p>Blogging is one of the oldest methods for making money online. People who love writing tend to start blogs with a niche focus. For example, a blog about procrastination, cars, dropshipping, toys, etc., is often a narrow enough focus to build a loyal following and big enough that you can cover a lot of ground.</p>
      <p>You can start a blog on various platforms, from Shopify (remove the checkout feature, so you don’t have to pay a subscription as you build it out) to WordPress. When you start your blog, focus on very specific keywords with a tight focus and continue to expand into other but still relevant categories as you grow and dominate new spaces. This will allow you to build a massive blog over time. Remember that design is also important for making a good first impression on visitors. Here are 20 blog design inspirations to help you launch your blog.</p>
      <p>There are several ways to make money blogging. You can add affiliate links in your posts (don’t forget a disclaimer). You can monetize your blog by placing ads strategically in your posts. Sponsored posts can help you make money from specific brands—this is popular among review bloggers. Bloggers can also sell digital or physical products on their websites. You can also use a blog to build a personal brand that helps you get speaking gigs, television deals, or big contracts from clients. </p>

      <h1>22. Consider freelancing</h1>
      <p>The easiest way to make money online is to take your current job in your 9-to-5 role and do it online instead. For example, if you’re a writer, administrative assistant, graphic designer, teacher, developer, etc., you can market these skills and find clients online who are willing to pay you to apply them.</p>
      <p>There’s a never-ending list of job platforms for each type of freelancer too. For example, freelance writers can apply for jobs on specific online writing job boards, but also on general freelance websites like Fiverr, Freelancer, Upwork, and all the others. If you find that your skills can’t be directly used to create income streams, you can try monetizing other transferable skills you may have. </p>
      <p>To make money online as a freelancer, you need to start by building out a strong portfolio. That may mean doing some free work with some reputable mid-tier brands to start. Once you create a strong portfolio, you can reach out to potential big clients to earn more money online. Remember, freelancing is a numbers game: the more personalized emails and applications you fill out, the more likely you’ll be to get a response back.</p>
      
      
      
      <h1>23. Create an app</h1>
      <p>If you’re not a developer, you’re probably looking at this money-making idea and feeling a bit stuck. Fortunately, though, you can hire someone with programming skills to build an app for you. Sites like <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Toptal</a> will connect you with plenty of app developers who are open to working with entrepreneurs to turn their vision into reality.</p>
      <p>All you have to do is come up with a unique app idea, identify the audience you want to target, and create a brand image for your product. The programmer you hire will take care of things on the development front.</p>
      <p>When it comes to making money on your app, your best bet will be to add it to Google Play and the App Store. And while it may seem counterintuitive, having a free app can help you make more than a paid app. With a free app, you can add ads or premium features to help you make money. Since the free app will attract a higher volume of people, it’ll be easier for you to upsell them.</p>

      <h1>24. Become a writer</h1>
      <p>With a growing interest in content marketing, more and more companies are looking for writers who can fill their web properties with great content. The secret to succeeding as a writer is to focus on a specific niche. A lot of writers try to be generalists, writing for a wide range of categories, from food to tech. However, having a niche focus as a writer sets you apart and makes it easier to attract clients in your target market.</p>
      <p>When you have experience in the niche, you can add a different perspective to a piece of content. That means you’re not just saying the same thing as every other writer online. And that’s what brands really want to pay for—your thoughts, experiences, and insider perspective on a niche.</p>
      <p>When applying for writing jobs, make sure to send relevant samples to the recruiter. If someone asks for a marketing writing sample, send them a marketing writing sample. Don’t send a finance article. Or a fitness one. It’s hard for a hiring manager </p>

      <h1>25.  Do side gigs</h1>
      <p><a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Side gigs</a> can help you make money online while you keep your full-time job. If you’re looking to make an extra couple hundred dollars per month, this is a great idea. The work doesn’t always last long-term, but it can.</p>
      <p>Use platforms like <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">Fiverr</a> to find part-time gigs that you can do online. As a new entrant in the gig economy, you’ll want to focus on offering a low price so you can get your first review. I’d recommend getting a friend to buy your gig to leave your first review so you can get started faster. Treat the friend like a client and actually deliver a finished product that you can feature in your portfolio. </p>
      <p>The thing with Fiverr is that it’s also a numbers game. If you look at top Fiverr users, you’ll see that they have multiple gigs available. The more gigs you have, the more likely you will be found.</p>
      
      <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"><img src="../images/dosidegigs.png" class="postimages" alt=""></a>
      <p>If you don’t want to get paid Fiverr prices, you can turn to platforms like FlexJobs to find side gigs. Under its jobs section, you can search for contract or telecommute opportunities. The great thing about the telecommute opportunities on <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611">FlexJobs</a> is that you can apply for them in any city in the world. </p>
      <p>FlexJobs has a variety of side gigs including writing, business, design, accounting, and more. So if your talents don’t match up with anything else on this list of money-making ideas, you might want to try a side gig from FlexJobs. Applying to multiple opportunities will increase your chances of landing a few gigs in a short period. </p>
      
      
      
      <h1>26. Sell your stuff</h1>
      <p>An easy way to make extra cash is to sell the stuff you no longer use. When using this strategy, make sure the items you put up for sale are of value to today’s buyers. </p>
      <p>Most people immediately think of selling their junk like old CDs and DVDs. But most people don’t want to buy those things. It’s 2022—are you really going to buy a CD? Probably not. So don’t waste your time trying to sell it. </p>
      <p>When you’re thinking about selling your stuff, focus on items like electronics, furniture, toys, and crafts. You can list the same products on multiple platforms, including Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, and your own online store. Multichannel selling will improve your chances of finding customers for your items. </p>
      <p>Want to make a great first impression on the customer? Include high-quality product images in your listings. You can hire a Shopify Expert to create product photos for you or take a photography course that equips you with the skills to shoot and edit your own images.</p>

      <h1>27. Become an online tutor</h1>
      <p>If you want to make money online on your own schedule, consider becoming an online tutor. Studenomics covered a story of a person who made $2,100 in one semester from tutoring. Interestingly, he built up his client base through word of mouth, visibility, and great group rates. </p>
      <p>If you have a teaching degree, you may be more likely to land a tutoring position. Having a degree or experience in a language is essential for this type of job. If you’ve spoken at a conference or event about the topic, you might also be considered for an online tutoring, teaching, or mentoring position. </p>
      <p>While sciences and maths often have a high demand for tutoring positions, you’ll also find English popular among international audiences. If you’re an expert on a topic, tutoring may be the right platform for you to make money fast.</p>

      <h1>28. Drive Your Car</h1>
      <p>If you own a car, you can make some spare cash as an Uber driver or delivery person. But even if you don’t, you can still deliver food and other essentials using your bicycle or moped. Uber drivers looking to make even more money off their car can turn their vehicle into a moving billboard using <a href="//gaimoupy.net/4/5248611"> Free Car Media</a>. In this case, the company will wrap your car with a removable vinyl featuring an advert for a product or brand.</p>
